If it does not work, your computer's java may need to be updated.


The current program supports an overworld JRPG style map as well as visual novel style cutscenes, run in a state stack (because game state systems are not good enough)

The map has functionality for bounds, triggers, objects, and NPCs
It has partial and will soon have full shadow functionality for the night portions of the game
It is in need of AI for running enemies during the night protion.

The cunscenes for functionality for character image tracking, choices, partial map manipulation, boolean trackering, and boolean conditions
It has partial functionality for character image/name tracking which will allow sprites to be shown on the sides and manipulated


List of things to do:
-finish CutsceneCharacter implementation
-create loadMap() function
-integrate flashlight functionality
-create enemy AI
-add more items to this list


Scripting intructions for those writing cutscenes to come after completion of cutscenes
